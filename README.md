# todo_app

Bloc (Business Logic Component) is an application architecture used in Flutter app development to manage the business logic of the app. Bloc separates the app logic from the user interface and manages the data displayed on the screen. This makes the app easier to manage and develop, as well as making maintenance and testing simpler.
